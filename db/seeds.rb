Song.create singer: lionel,  duration: 241, title: "Hello", lyrics: "I've been alone with you Inside my mind And in my dreams I've kissed your lips A thousand times I sometimes see you Pass outside my door Hello! Is it me you're looking for? I can see it in your eyes I can see it in your smile You're all I've ever wanted And my arms are open wide 'cause you know just what to say And you know just what to do And I want to tell you so much I love you I long to see the sunlight in your hair And tell you time and time again How much I care Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow Hello! I've just got to let you know 'cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely? Or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying I love you Hello! Is it me you're looking for? 'cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely? Or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying I love you"

Everybody start to lose control When the music is right If you see somebody hangin' around Don't get uptight The only thing we want to do tonight Is go 'round and 'round And turn upside down Come on! Let's get down! So come on! Let's get loose Don't hold back 'Cause ain't no use Hard to keep your feet on the ground 'Cause when we like to party We only want to get down Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Say what? Can't stop now Just getting started Everybody clap your hands Come on Everybody let's dance (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling Oh, what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling baby baby We gonna dance all night Read more: Lionel Richie - Dancing On The Ceiling Lyrics | MetroLyrics "
Song.create singer: michael, duration: 244, title: "When a Man Loves a Woman", lyrics: "When a man loves a woman Can't keep his mind on nothing else He'll trade the world For the good thing he's found If she's bad he can't see it She can do no wrong Turn his back on his best friend If he put her down When a man loves a woman Spend his very last dime Trying to hold on to what he needs He'd give up all his comfort Sleep out in the rain If she said that's the way it ought to be Well, this man loves a woman I gave you everything I had Trying to hold on to your precious love Baby, please don't treat me bad When a man loves a woman Down deep in his soul She can bring him such misery If she plays him for a fool He's the last one to know Loving eyes can't ever see When a man loves a woman He can do no wrong He can never own some other girl Yes when a man loves a woman I know exactly how he feels 'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world When a man loves a woman"

Song.create singer: cascada, duration: 215, title: "Everytime We Touch", lyrics: "I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me. I still feel your touch in my dream. Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive. 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling. And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly. Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. Need you by my side. 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static. And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky. Can't you feel my heart beat so... I can't let you go. Want you in my life. Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky. They wipe away tears that I cry. The good and the bad times, we've been through them all. You make me rise when I fall. 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling. And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly. Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. Need you by my side. 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static. And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky. Can't you feel my heart beat so... I can't let you go. Want you in my life. 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling. And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly. Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. Need you by my side."
